# VICERA Homepage

Welcome to the Vicera official documentation. In this place you will find a full
documentation of all the aspect of this 8-bit fantasy console.

**NOTE** The documentation may contain a few grammatical and spelling errors
because I am not natively speaking English. If there are errors, please do a
pull request or post an issue [here](https://github.com/vicera/docs). Thanks.
