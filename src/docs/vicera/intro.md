# VICERA Documentation

## Introduction

The VICERA is a fantasy console that aims to be more than just a game engine
with some limitations like most of the FCs. This one aims to emulate a whole
fantasy system with it's own CPU and instruction set. It has been heavily
inspired by the Nintendo Gameboy, a classic in the handheld consoles industry.

It has 64 KiB of RAM, an 8-bit CPU with 16-bit addressing, a 160x160 monochrome
screen and a GPU that works with tiles and sprites. You can store up to 256
tiles and up to 64 sprites.

I will try to document all the aspects of the software, and add a few developer
notes at the end of each chapter for people who likes to play arround with the
code.
