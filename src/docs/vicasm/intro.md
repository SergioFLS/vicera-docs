# VICasm Documentation

## Introduction

The vicasm assembler is the official assembler for the VIC-8P CPU. It may not
be a complete assembler with a pre-processor and stuff but is enough (to me
anyways) to write programs with it. It features an Intel-style syntax, a few
pseudo-instructions and label support.

### Developer Notes

The codebase is kind of a mess :pensibe:
