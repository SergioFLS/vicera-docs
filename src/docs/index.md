# VICERA Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation of the VICERA project. This site will
provide docs for all the VICERA project software such as the VICERA (obviously),
VICasm, and future software that may be developed.

I am not native English, I am neither good at documenting things but I will do
my best so people can understand (and finally use my software without having to
read some C or C++ lines of code).
